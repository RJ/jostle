# Jostle

* Game using the Playstation Move controllers, inspired by JS Joust.
* Uses https://github.com/thp/psmoveapi
* Mostly written on the ferry between Hooke van Holland and Harwich.
* Pretty basic..

# Instructions

* Pair all the controllers
* Controllers pulse green: pull trigger to join the game, you go solid green when queued up
* When all players have joined, or 2+ players have joined and the rest
  have timed out, the game starts
* All players go solid white when the game is on
* If you get jostled, you blink red
* If you get jostled too hard, you go solid red then the light turns
  off, you are dead. 
* Do not jostle other players once you are dead.
* It's just a game; no kicking, biting or eye-gouging.
* Last one alive wins.
